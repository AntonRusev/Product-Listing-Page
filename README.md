# What is Product Listing Page

Product Listing Page is designed to resemble an e-commerce store. The goal of the application is to showcase various Front-End development techniques of dynamic interaction(such as sorting and filtering) and displaying of products. 

The products data used by the application is hard-coded and locally stored, meaning there is no interaction with REST API.
